# üìù Speech to Text for Transcription Services

## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Speech-to-Text (STT)** pipeline using Python libraries to transcribe audio files into text. It can be used for applications like note-taking, caption generation, or transcription services.

---

## üìÇ File Structure

The notebook includes the following main sections:

### 1. **Library Installation**

Installs necessary packages:

```python
!pip install SpeechRecognition pydub
```

### 2. **Import Required Libraries**

Includes essential packages:

```python
import speech_recognition as sr
from pydub import AudioSegment
import os
```

### 3. **Audio Format Conversion**

Handles MP3 to WAV conversion using `pydub`:

```python
audio = AudioSegment.from_mp3("audio.mp3")
audio.export("converted.wav", format="wav")
```

### 4. **Transcription Using SpeechRecognition**

Uses `speech_recognition` to transcribe the WAV audio:

```python
r = sr.Recognizer()
with sr.AudioFile("converted.wav") as source:
    audio_text = r.listen(source)
    text = r.recognize_google(audio_text)
    print(text)
```

### 5. **Error Handling**

Includes a try-except block to handle possible errors like:

* `UnknownValueError` (if audio is not clear)
* `RequestError` (if there's an issue with API calls)

---

## üõ† Requirements

Make sure to have the following:

* Python 3.x
* Libraries: `SpeechRecognition`, `pydub`
* **ffmpeg** installed on your system (required by `pydub` for format conversion)

---

## ‚úÖ Usage Steps

1. Place an audio file (`.mp3`) in the working directory.
2. Run the conversion cell to convert it to `.wav`.
3. Transcribe using the `recognize_google()` method.
4. Read or save the resulting text.

## üöÄ Future Improvements (suggested in notebook or implied)

* Use other APIs (IBM Watson, Azure, etc.) for better accuracy.
* Add UI or batch processing capabilities.
* Improve noise filtering.
